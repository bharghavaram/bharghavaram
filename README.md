- ⚡ Fun fact:AI-powered robots have roots in ancient myths, even in India! The Indian mythological concept of automata can be traced back to the ancient scriptures. One example is the story of "Samsara," the mechanical servants created by skilled artisans, often described as intelligent beings capable of performing complex tasks. These early visions of automated beings demonstrate how ancient Indian thinkers, like their Greek counterparts, envisioned the idea of intelligence and automation long before modern technology brought them to life.

This ancient imagination paved the way for today's AI-powered robotics, showing the timeless human curiosity about creating machines that can think and act independently.
